# LDTS_04_05 - Cross the Map

Our game consists in a text-based version of the Crossy Road game with some SuperMario combinations and some new characters.

The main character is Jack the Sparrow who is trying to free his Princess and for that he needs to avoid the Pirates and all explosions from the bombs and collect the special key.

For the player to win the game with the highest score, it needs to catch all the biscuits, which represents the score, and the special key to open the prison door where the Princess is being kept.

After rescuing the Princess a door is opened and Jack needs to leave the map through that door.

Each biscuit that Jack catches makes his score go up, but these are not necessary to release the Princess and finish the game.

## Implemented Features

### Jack the Sparrow

- **Movement** - The game character will move according to the direction of the arrow key pressed, and he can´t walk through the borders.
<p align="center">
    <img width="550" src="images/jackMoves.gif">
</p>

- **Getting biscuits** - When Jack hits a biscuit his score goes up by one biscuit until he reaches the maximum score.
<p align="center">
    <img width=550 src="images/catchCoockie.gif">
</p>

- **Catching key** - For Jack to release his beloved Princess he needs to catch the key to open the prison door.

</p>

</p>

- **Lives** - Collisions are implemented so that each time Jack gets hit by one of the pirates he loses a life. When the game starts Jack has 3 lives, and if he loses them all he dies.

    <img width=550 src="images/losingLivesAndTheGame.gif">
</p>

### Enemies

- **Movement** - Each enemy moves independently horizontally and when they hit a border their direction changes. Bomber planes will randomly drop bombs.
<p align="center">
    <img width=550 src="images/enemiesMoves.gif">
</p>

- **Removing lives** - Any Enemy that hits Jack removes one of the three lives he has. If Jack is nearby a bomb explosion, he will also lose one life.

### Princess

- **Following Jack** - When Jack enters the prison, the Princess will start following until they leave the map.

## Features

- **Different Pirates** - We will make three kinds of Pirates, each one with different speeds and the bigger one will leave bombs behind.
- **Menu** - There will be a menu when you open the game with some buttons.
- **Personalized Font** - We'll create a new font to have our characters and some objects printed on the game.
- **Game Over** - After you die there will be a message on the screen saying that you've died and if you want to restart playing.
- **Lives and score** - On the lower portion of the game will have the amount of lives remaining and how many biscuits you have caught.

## Design

### Enemies

#### Problem in Context
Our game had two different enemies that behaved very similarly. It is like the game had two variants of an enemy.

#### Pattern
We implemented the **Template Method**. It implements a skeleton of an algorithm in the _Enemies_ abstract class and all the 
different enemies that extend this abstract class can override the methods to accommodate them in the better way without changing the super class.
#### Implementation
<p align="center">
    <img width=550 src="UML/TemplateMethodEnemies.png">
</p>

#### Consequences
* More classes.
* Override the draw method.
* Less repetitive code.

### Components

#### Problem in Context
Similarly to the enemies' problem our game had many components that used the same methods. 

#### Pattern
We implemented the **Template Method**. It implements a skeleton of an algorithm in the _Components_ abstract class and all the
different components that extend this abstract class can override the methods to accommodate them in the better way without changing the super class.

In this case we didn't override any of the implemented methods because it was just a couple of sets and gets for each components' position.
#### Implementation
<p align="center">
    <img width=550 src="UML/TemplateMethodComponents.png">
</p>

#### Consequences
* More classes.
* Less repetitive code.

### Characters

#### Problem in Context
Since the beginning we knew we would have a lot of moving characters in our game and even if they don't act all the same way there are only some subtle changes.
#### Pattern
With this in mind we decided to use the **Abstract Factory** to help us design our code in a better way. Implemented an interface with all common methods to every character.
#### Implementation
<p align="center">
    <img width=550 src="UML/AbstractFactoryCharacters.png">
</p>

#### Consequences
* One additional interface.
* Code organization improved.


## Code Smells and Possible Refactorings
### Bloaters Large Class

Our classes Game and Map contain many fields and methods.
In both cases, we find it justifiable as the classes require these fields,
in one hand the Game class is the main class of the program and it needs to store a considerable amount of data,
on the other hand with a different code structure, it could have fewer methods and be more organized (extract method).

In Map there are a lot of methods that are necessary. Method related to everything that happens during our Game time and that deal with different classes.
Some methods could be **extracted**. 

### Couplers Feature Envy
In Map there are some methods that could be **extracted** but since they require information about other classes
we don't **extract** them to keep our relations simpler. There are cases where we could use inline methods in various larger methods to keep them smaller and with less duplicate code.

## Testing

### Coverage Report
<p align="center">
    <img width=550 src="images/finalReportCoverage.png">
</p>

### Mutation Test
>This doesn't envolve some of the coverage because we had problems due to opening the terminal from lanterna in some of
>  the mutation tests it would crash. From this it was necessary to comment out the methods causing this problem.
> In conclusion we ended up with two kinds of coverage reports. The one [above](#coverage-report) didn't implement pitest and reached a higher coverage
> percentage. The report below used Pit test for a lower coverage percentage compared to the report [above](#coverage-report).
